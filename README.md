## Introduction

Welcome to the **Rescue Management System** a database project! This system helps in managing various aspects of emergency services, including resource allocation, rescue operations, and incident tracking.

## Project Overview

The **Rescue Management System** is designed to:
- Manage rescue operations and emergency responses.
- Track rescue personnel, vehicles, and resources.
- Record incidents and log response times.
- Provide an organized database for efficient emergency service management.

## Installation

To set up the **Rescue Management System** database on your local system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rescue-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd rescue-management-system
   ```

3. **Create and set up the database**:
   ```bash
   mysql -u your-username -p
   CREATE DATABASE RescueManagement;
   USE RescueManagement;
   ```

4. **Run the SQL scripts to create tables and insert data**:
   ```bash
   SOURCE RescueSQL.sql;
   ```

## File Structure

Here is the structure of the project:

- [`RescueSQL.sql`](RescueSQL.sql): The SQL file containing all SQL queries for creating and populating the database.
- [`zainkashif1110.docx`](zainkashif1110.docx): The DOCX file with detailed documentation about the project.
- [`RESCUE(ERD).png`](RESCUE(ERD).png): The PNG file containing the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the project.
- [`RESCUE(RS).png`](RESCUE(RS).png): The PNG file containing the Relational Schema of the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**:
  - SQL: Used for creating, managing, and manipulating the database.
  
- **Software**:
  - MySQL: The database management system used to implement the project.
  - ERD PLUS: For designing the [Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)](RESCUE(ERD).png) and [Relational Schema (RS)](RESCUE(RS).png).
  - Word Processor: For documenting the project details.

## Entities and Attributes

Detailed information about entities and their attributes can be found in the attached [zainkashif1110.docx](zainkashif1110.docx) file.

## Relationships

The relationships between entities are outline in the [zainkashif1110.docx](zainkashif1110.docx) document. 

## Entity Relationship Diagram

Refer to the [RESCUE(ERD).png](RESCUE(ERD).png) file for a visual representation of the Entity-Relationship Diagram.

## Relational Schema

The relational schema for this project is defined in the SQL script file [RescueSQL.sql](RescueSQL.sql). For a visual representation, refer to the [RESCUE(RS).png](RESCUE(RS).png) file.

## SQL Scripts

### Database Creation and Table Definition

- Run the SQL script [RescueSQL.sql](RescueSQL.sql) to create the database schema:

  ```sql
  -- Create the database
  CREATE DATABASE RescueManagement;
  USE RescueManagement;

  -- Create tables and set up relationships
  SOURCE RescueSQL.sql;
  ```

## Future Improvements

- **User Interface**: Develop a front-end interface for managing rescue operations in real-time.
- **Reporting Features**: Add analytics and reporting features for response times, personnel efficiency, and resource usage.
- **Real-Time Data**: Implement real-time tracking of vehicles and personnel during rescue operations.
